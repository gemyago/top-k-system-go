# This dockerfile is used to build the final small image.
# It copies the built binary from the build image to the runtime image.
# Alternative is to build binarries on host and copy them to the runtime image.
# This is done via Dockerfile.host file.

ARG BUILD_IMAGE=localhost:6000/app:latest
# RUNTIME_IMAGE is set in the docker.variables.mk file
